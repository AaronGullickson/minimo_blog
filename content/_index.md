My name is Aaron Gullickson. I am an Associate Professor of [Sociology at the University of Oregon](https://sociology.uoregon.edu/). I am also a demographer by training, a total data science nerd, a [git](https://git-scm.com/) evangelist, and an open science advocate. I am also currently co-editor of [Socius](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/srd), the open-access journal of the American Sociological Association.

Most of my empirical work uses large scale census and survey data to look at issues of race mixing or racial ambiguity. I examine racial classification, identification, interracial marriage, and life outcomes by race. More recently, I have begun studying religious identity as well, particularly among the growing number of people with no formal religious affiliation. Since I started using git to track my research projects, all of my research projects are available publicly as git repositories on [Github](https://github.com/AaronGullickson).

I am trained in a variety of statistical programs, but I almost exclusively use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) in my work these days. In addition to my research, I teach a first-year graduate sequence in statistics that focuses heavily on the practical issues of data analysis. I also teach a course for [Code Horizons](https://codehorizons.com/) specifically about using [GitHub for Data Analysis](https://codehorizons.com/Seminars/github-for-data-analysis/).

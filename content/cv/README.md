# How to update the CV

CV data comes from an external google sheet. To get the CV to recompile locally to see changes, I need to make a random change to the index.Rmd of the cv directory., like adding a space.

I also need to update the PDF from the separate [my_vitae](https://github.com/AaronGullickson/my_vitae) project.
